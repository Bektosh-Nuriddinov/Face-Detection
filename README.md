## Face-Detection
This project can detect human face using comera.The project is based on artificial intelligence, written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, and the model training part uses [YOLOV8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) provided by ultralytics, and the interface is made using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).<br>

100 epoch have passed in the sample train process. Accuracy is 84.2%.This was a trial project, it was trained in fewer periods. If you need higher accuracy, increase the epoch and you will achieve the goal.

### Install
<il>First, you must have the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language installed on your computer. If it is not installed, install it.</il>
<il>Then download this project to your computer.</il>
